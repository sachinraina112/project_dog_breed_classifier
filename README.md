# project_dog_breed_classifier

In this project, I have built an application algorithm that classifies dog breed out of given 133 dog breed types.
Below is the description about the notebook:
1) At the end of this project, my code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
2) I have implemented both CNN from scratch and transfer learning (VGG16) to correctly classify the dog breed.

Download the dog dataset here(https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). The dogImages/ folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.

Download the human dataset here(http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).
